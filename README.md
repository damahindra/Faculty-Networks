# Faculty-Networks
Final Project of Internet Architecture and Protocol subject at Brawijaya University's IT Major

In this project, we are challenged to make a routing architecture for 3 faculties using 4 routing protocols : Static, OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol), and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol).

**a) Static Routing Protocol**
----------------------------------------------------
We use this protocol to make a routing architecture for the Faculty of Fisheries and Marine Science at Brawijaya University, which consists of : Building A with Lecturer's Office and Lab area, and also Building B with the wifi area.

**b) EIGRP Routing Protocol**
----------------------------------------------------
We use this protocol to make a routing architecture for the Faculty of Administrative Science at Brawijaya University, which consists of : Building A with Lecturer's Office and Lab area, and also Building B with the wifi area.

**c) OSPF Routing Protocol**
----------------------------------------------------
We use this protocol to make a routing architecture for the Faculty of Computer Science at Brawijaya University, which consists of : Building A with Lecturer's Office and Lab area, and also Building B with the wifi area.

**d) BGP Routing Protocol**
----------------------------------------------------
We use this protocol to connect the routers of each respective faculties. With this protocol, these faculties can communicate with each other despite the different protocols that are used.
