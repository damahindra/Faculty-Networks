# Faculty-Networks
Final Project of Internet Architecture and Protocol subject at Brawijaya University's IT Major

In this project, we are challenged to make a routing architecture for 3 faculties using 4 routing protocols : Static, OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol), and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol).

**a) Static Routing Protocol**
----------------------------------------------------
We use this protocol to make a routing architecture for the Faculty of Fisheries and Marine Science at Brawijaya University, which consists of : Building A with Lecturer's Office and Lab area, and also Building B with the wifi area.

Here are the routing tables for each router in the network

With the configuration of those routers, we can achieve successful connections for the faculty's internal network
